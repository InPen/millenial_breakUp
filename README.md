# millenial_breakUp

Have you ever wanted to just vent after a heart wrenching break up without having others judge you by what you post?

Lots of heart broken millenials have already joined, why haven't you? Try it out!

## Future Goals
* Be able to post pictures taken from Snapchat
* Incorporate private messaging between users
* Have private messaging be encrypted
* Be much more mobile friendly
* Not sure yet, due to the Anonymously of the app, but maybe allow users to like and share each others' post
